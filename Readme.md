## **Explainable Media Bias Detection and Analysis**

1. The *code/* folder contains the notebooks of sentence and article datasets.
2. The *feature_engineering_cleaning_preprocessing_code/* folder contains the raw datasets cleaing, preprocessing code through which we get the datasets of article and sentences in the *featured_datasets/* folder.
3. The keyword related data can be found in *keywords_phrases/* folder.
4. Fallacy features use trained models to extract features, that we can use with models in the *fallacy_feature_models/* folder.
5. Finally, the explainability of **SHAP** features are given in local and global plots under *assets/* section.
